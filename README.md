# Advanced Encryption Standard Encoding üóúÔ∏è

This project is an application of the Advanced Encryption Standard encoding using the hardware language SystemVerilog. This project can encrypt sensitive data using a secret key. AES helps protect data from being stolen, altered or compromised. This project is simulated with ModelSim and synthesized with VCS Synopsys.

## Introduction üìö

AES is a block cipher algorithm that was chosen as the standard encryption algorithm by the U.S. government in 2001. AES was developed by two Belgian cryptographers, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, based on their Rijndael algorithm. AES can use keys of 128, 192 or 256 bits to encrypt and decrypt data blocks of 128 bits. AES operates in rounds, each round consisting of four main steps: byte substitution (SubBytes), row shift (ShiftRows), column mix (MixColumns) and key addition (AddRoundKey). The number of rounds depends on the key length, specifically 10 rounds for 128-bit keys, 12 rounds for 192-bit keys and 14 rounds for 256-bit keys. AES is considered one of the strongest encryption algorithms today, widely used in many fields such as military, government, finance, network security and communication.
